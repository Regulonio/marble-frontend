# openapi-backend

This API definition is intended to to be a good starting point for
describing the API between frontend and backend at Marble. The ultimate goal of this document is to serve as a single source of truth, following the [design first approach](https://oai.github.io/Documentation/best-practices.html#use-a-design-first-approach).

It makes use of [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/Redoc) and is based on the approach described [here](https://github.com/Redocly/create-openapi-repo).
